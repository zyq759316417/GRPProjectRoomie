## Project details

`Title`: Roomie<br>
`Description`: Nowadays smart home systems are rising in our country. <br>
Although smart home systems benefit a lot, there is no such a real-time <br>
equipment which designed to monitoring the condition of human body and <br>
the surrounding environment. Therefore, this project is by using a wearable <br> 
device and external sensors to infer user comfort and attempt to suggest or <br>
automatically control the userâ€™s immediate environment according to their <br>
preferences. For more details: [click here](https://github.com/zyq759316417/GRPProjectRoomie/blob/master/PublicDoc/2018.P10.Roomie.pdf)
